# anticonf

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of anticonf is to explore *configure* ... particularly [autoconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoconf) which is widely used
in R for *generating a configure script* for building from source against a system library installation, and a (lighthearted? and) informal (?) modern unpacking of that referred to as [anticonf](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc/blob/main/configure) that just creates a configure script manually, with some templated patterns.
